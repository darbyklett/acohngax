UPDATE: 5/11 Account was restored!!! Randomly logged in to find out in the evening of 5/11, just to check and I found out that I could log in. No email response received though. Made a 4th ticket on eve of 5/10 after and checked after 24 hours of no response. Was probably restored earlier, but honestly I don't know when it was. The Last time I checked was after my 3rd ticket created on 5/8. No direct contact with anyone; not a single c2u staff, it was just recovered. Honestly I think. Permalink.

The Delphi Murders - An Investigator’s Update My last post ( here ( https://www.reddit.com/r/DelphiMurders/comments/8u69jj/delphi_murders_an_investigators_perspective/?st=juumri5oampsh=0f6207f1)) received much more attention then I expected it to get and I would like to thank those of you were kind enough to post nice comments and to those who gave me reddit gold and premium. I have been messaged by several of you asking for my thoughts and comments on the press conference recently.

After a lot of convincing and advice from redditors (I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!) we finally informed her FH (now DH) who immediately chucked his sis and mom out of the wedding. First off, the wedding was awesome. Simply beautiful. At twilight in an orchard decorated.

My husband works for a pretty prestigious university as the director of student life. He oversees a decent sized staff, and their work encompasses all manners of student activities, groups, Greek life, etc. A little background before I get to ~the incident~, a few months ago we were expecting our baby. Most people on campus knew this, and knew that my husband, let’s call him Joe, would be taking paternity.

With the recent drama going on with Whisper of the Worm, Sleeper, super-returning exotics and all of that garbage, I’ve decided that I’m actually going to do something productive. And that productivity comes in the form of my own fan-made patch notes that would make me cream my pants in excitement if I woke up and saw that the changes were real # Season of Opulence Fan Made Patch Notes Season of Opulence is on fast approach and, similar to past Seasons, some sandbox changes will arrive I have had 19 to 20 years of living with my mother I dont even know where to start. I'm twenty two this year and an only child. It is like opening a deep festering wound. It took me awhile before I had decided I should post this. The topics branch out too, so I will just reveal everything related to this title only.

parts 1amp2 Kira pressed his back tightly to the damp stone wall, clutching his sword in one hand and a torch in the other. It was the moment he'd been waiting for his entire life; what years of turmoil and training had brought him to. The climax of his existence. Something clinked from the adjacent room, like a dropped purse of gold, followed by a low growl and strange chittering. The smell of wet mineral and sulfur filled his nose, a chill setting into his spine. He took a deep breat.

Tubes of meat and metal slide out of their bodies. This, my implant has zero complaints about. Killing Xenos is always. I'm almost positive that Jon and Co will lose at Winterfell. Why you may ask? This is a story made by GRRM do you really think that something this hyped up will get demolished in one or two episodes? I don't think so. There is plenty of proof and foreshadowing that the real battle will happen at the Trident, not at Winterfell. amp#x200B; Here is my evidence: amp#x200B; Dany's Dream gtThat night she dreamt that she was Rhaegar, riding to the Trident .

"What have you done?!" The crackling roar deafened the com unit in his ear. "Withdraw immediately! You have no orders for this!" His teeth ached at the force of his own snarl. "That's a no, ma'am." His own reply was far quieter by comparison - a meer shudder of breath as he aimed towards the flaring light before him. "Trividor Devrin, if you do not desist at once, we will have no choice but to end this course for you." Silence fell over the com unit, leaving an odd ringing My name is Adam and, yeah, like the title says I was lately the pianist for the Grand Luciferian Temple of Gehenna located just outside of Dublin, Texas. Haven’t heard of it? Doesn’t surprise me. And before you ask, no, I wasn’t a Temple member or even a believer in any of that Satanic black magic mumbo-jumbo crap. Hell, I was raised Methodist. It was just another job as far as I was concerned; one I took out of necessity more than anything else. At twenty-two years old, fresh Hello everyone. Welcome to my guide on how to properly DDL. This guide is intented to be very noob friendly so at times you might think I'm talking about some things way too long. I'm making this guide because almost everyday I see posts from new people about; - I got a copyright letter from my ISP/copyright troll. - Just throw it in the trash. Don't admit anything. Get a VPN if you want to continue torrenting. - Are free browser V-P-N's enough? - No! - Is PeerGuardian enough? A lone gasheran man was tinkering with an old black and white television. Surrounding him were similarly old pieces of technology within a storefront that sold salvage and antiques like a thrift store. It was almost the gasheran equivalent. His head perked up upon hearing a bell ringing, an indication that someone entered his store, and he promptly stopped what he was doing to return to a small store counter. There, near the entrance, he saw a human man wearing a black leather jacket. When I got home, finding a demon on my couch was not what I expected. He was dark as the night, half the size of a man, with white, ram-like horns, and large blue claws. Little cascades of flames fell down his slitted eyes, turning the tub of ice cream he was holding into soup. He was sobbing like a teenager who just had his heart broken for the first time, and I had my suspicions that his sobs were connected with the little tremors shaking the ground. There was fear in my heart, and worries. Standing in front of Hikone, who was on the verge of losing consciousness, Hisagi glanced at Kyoraku, “I’m going to end my Bankai, but the moment I do so, please do not hurt Hikone.” “Come on, do I really look that heartless to you?” Kyoraku shrugged his shoulders and replied with a serious expression. “It’s alright. If I do such a thing, that young lady will stop halting the fall of the aerial castle.” Something was already happening to the clouds around the castle. The clouds surround. it's 2 am, but lt3 it- I have and idea I have to write. amp#x200B; lt---gt amp#x200B; Maybe if I had instructed a harder turn earlier, we would still be steaming to Brest and come home for dinner tonight. amp#x200B; But it's too late now. amp#x200B; Only a delusional fool would think that this battle is winnable; We can't fire back effectively as the rudder is stuck twelve degrees degrees to port- messing with the rangefinders and not giving fire control any numbers. 
UPDATE: (scroll down for original post) amp#x200B; Before heading to her place I dipped into the HaHa cafe comedy club to rip a couple planks and with them some gas. I thought this was a great sign and that the gas could have only been associated with whatever meal those nuggets were. Laced with broccoli my guess. amp#x200B; But as I was washing my hands I saw how bloated my guts were, big ol' gas bubble. Dead give away another low pressure system was making its way to the launch.

TL;DR Excessive DRM on movies forced me to pirate because it is almost impossible to play 4k movies. amp#x200B; For me, it was because I just wanted to watch a fucking movie and I couldn't do it legally. So, I started going to the cinema again and enjoying movies. I want to watch some movies in Blu-Ray because DVDs are bad quality. I buy a Blu-Ray drive and some Blu-Rays, was around £45 for the drive and £30 in Blu-Rays, I've supported the industry, now I want to wat- oh, you can't watch. </p>
